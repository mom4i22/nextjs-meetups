# nextjs-meetups
A web app made with Next.js from my React course.
Features a functionality to view available meetups and a functionality to add a meetup which is saved in a MongoDB database. A meetup must have an image which you should
provide as a link. Deployed on Vercel -> https://nextjs-meetups-dslp.vercel.app/
